# OpenHands-Tab

This repository is a playground for the development and testing of the **OpenHands-Tab VS Code extension**.

## OpenHands-Tab VS Code Extension

The OpenHands-Tab extension integrates the power of OpenHands directly into your Visual Studio Code editor.

Features include:
*   An "OpenHands" tab in the VS Code Activity Bar.
*   A chat-like interface for sending prompts to the OpenHands agent.
*   Deep integration with VS Code for actions like opening files, viewing diffs, and executing commands.

For detailed information about the extension, please see the [OpenHands-Tab README](./openhands/runtime/utils/vscode-extensions/openhands-tab/README.md).
